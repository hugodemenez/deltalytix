# Dark mode and theme system

Trade analysis sessions can be long. Dark mode reduces eye strain during extended use, especially for night trading.

## How it works

Toggle between light and dark themes from the navigation bar. Your preference is saved and persists across sessions. The system can also follow your operating system's theme setting automatically.

## Key capabilities

- **Light theme**: Clean, bright interface for daytime use
- **Dark theme**: Reduced brightness for night sessions and low-light environments
- **System sync**: Automatically match your OS preference
- **Persistent selection**: Theme choice is remembered across sessions
- **Optimized charts**: All charts and graphs adapt colors for readability in both themes

## Visual adaptations

- Chart colors adjust for contrast
- Text remains readable in all conditions
- Tables and data displays maintain clarity
- UI elements preserve visual hierarchy
