# Improved reliability for trade operations and dashboard

We fixed edge cases that could prevent trade comments and video links from saving, and improved how dashboard layouts are saved and loaded.

When adding comments to trades or linking video reviews, these operations now work more consistently. Dashboard layouts also save and restore more reliably, so your custom widget arrangements persist correctly across sessions.

These improvements make the platform more stable when managing your trades and customizing your workspace.
