# CSV data import with calendar visualization

Deltalytix starts with the essentials: import your trading data and see your performance at a glance.

## How it works

Upload a CSV file containing your trades. The system validates and processes the data, then displays your trading activity on an interactive calendar. Each day shows your profit or loss, making it easy to spot patterns in your trading.

## Key capabilities

- **CSV file processing**: Upload trade data from any broker that exports CSV files
- **Automatic validation**: Data is checked for errors and inconsistencies during import
- **Calendar view**: See your daily PnL on a monthly calendar grid
- **Equity curve**: Track your account growth over time with a visual chart
- **Secure storage**: All data is stored in a PostgreSQL database with encryption

## Getting started

1. Export your trades as a CSV file from your broker
2. Upload the file in the Deltalytix dashboard
3. Map the columns if needed (or let the system auto-detect them)
4. View your trades on the calendar and equity chart
