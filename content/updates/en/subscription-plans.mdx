# Building the Future of Trading Analytics Together

After spending a full year day trading and experiencing firsthand the challenges that traders face, I've learned one crucial lesson: real trading success comes from practice, not from endless backtesting simulations.

## Why I Created Deltalytix

As a trader myself, I spent countless hours trying to perfect my strategy. What I discovered was that the most valuable insights came from actual trading experience – not from building complex backtesting systems. This realization led me to create Deltalytix, a platform focused on helping traders analyze their real trading performance and improve through practical experience.

## Our Vision

At Deltalytix, we have a clear vision: to provide traders with comprehensive journaling and analytics tools that let them focus on what truly matters – trading and refining their strategies. We want to eliminate the time wasted on building custom analysis tools and instead provide a unified platform where traders can gain meaningful insights from their actual trading data.

## Why Subscriptions Matter

The decision to introduce subscription plans wasn't taken lightly. Here's why it's important:

1. **Sustainable Development**: Your subscription directly funds ongoing development, allowing us to create new features and improve existing ones.

2. **Building Partnerships**: With a sustainable revenue model, we can forge partnerships with data providers and trading platforms to bring you better integration and more comprehensive tools.

3. **Community Investment**: Every subscriber becomes part of our journey to build better trading tools, helping us create features that address real trader needs.
