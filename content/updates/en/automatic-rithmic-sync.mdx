## How it works

Enter your Rithmic credentials in the account settings. Deltalytix connects to Rithmic's API and fetches your trades automatically. New trades appear in your dashboard within an hour of execution.

## Key capabilities

- **Hourly sync**: Trades are fetched every hour automatically
- **Historical import**: Pull up to 400 days of past trades
- **Multi-account support**: Connect multiple Rithmic accounts
- **Real-time feedback**: See sync status and progress
- **Secure connection**: Credentials are encrypted and stored safely

## Getting started

1. Go to account settings
2. Select "Connect Rithmic Account"
3. Enter your Rithmic credentials
4. Confirm the connection

Your trades will sync automatically from that point forward.
