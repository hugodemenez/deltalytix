# Summer Updates: Reflecting on Our Journey and What's Coming Next

As summer begins, I wanted to take a moment to share our incredible journey over the past year and give you a glimpse of what's coming next. What started as a personal frustration with Excel spreadsheets has grown into something truly remarkable.

## The Beginning: From Excel Hell to Trading Analytics

It all started in August 2024. I was deep into day trading US bonds futures on CBOT, executing DOM trades and scalping very short-timed positions. The strategy was working, but there was one massive problem: I was generating hundreds of trades per month, and compiling all that data in Excel was becoming a nightmare.

After a full year of wrestling with spreadsheets, copying and pasting trade data, and spending hours on manual calculations that should have taken minutes, I knew there had to be a better way. That's when I decided to build Deltalytix.

## Building with Real Traders

Instead of developing in isolation, I took a different approach. I onboarded 10 experienced traders and built the Deltalytix beta together with them over the first four months. This wasn't just user testing – it was collaborative development with people who understood the real challenges of trading analytics.

These early adopters helped shape everything from the core architecture to the smallest UI details. Every feature was battle-tested by traders who were using it with real money, real trades, and real pressure.

## The Public Launch and Explosive Growth

In January 2025, we made the decision to release Deltalytix to the public. What happened next exceeded all expectations.

We hit 50 weekly active users almost immediately, then 100, and now we're approaching 200 weekly active users. More than 500 traders have signed up and used our trading journal at least once. For a solo-developed, bootstrapped product, this growth has been both humbling and energizing.

## Staying True to Our Vision

Despite the rapid growth, I've remained committed to our original vision: building the best possible trading analytics platform without external pressure or compromises. I'm not interested in raising money right now – this gives us the freedom to focus entirely on what matters most: serving traders.

This bootstrapped approach means every feature we build is driven by actual user needs, not investor demands or market trends. It's allowed us to maintain our focus on creating a sleek, designed dashboard that helps traders visualize their data and save authentic track records.

## Current Focus: AI Enhancement

One of our most exciting recent additions has been our AI agent. It's already helping traders analyze their performance and identify patterns they might miss on their own. However, I know it's not reaching its full potential yet – it lacks comprehensive market data to provide truly contextual insights.

That's about to change in a big way.

## The Databento Partnership

This summer, I'm thrilled to announce that we're partnering with Databento to solve the market data challenge. This partnership will transform our AI agent from a helpful analytics tool into a comprehensive trading intelligence system.

With access to high-quality market data, our AI will be able to:
- Provide context-aware trade analysis
- Identify market conditions that align with your best performance
- Offer real-time insights based on current market dynamics
- Help you understand how broader market movements affect your trading

We're targeting a September 2025 release for these enhanced AI capabilities, and I believe this will be a game-changer for how traders interact with their data.

## The Vision: Authentic Track Records

Looking ahead, I'm excited about our plans for certificates of authenticity. By cross-referencing trading data with reliable prop firms, we'll be able to help traders prove their track records in a way that's never been possible before.

This isn't just about bragging rights – it's about creating opportunities. Whether you're applying to a trading firm, starting your own fund, or simply want to document your trading journey with complete authenticity, these certificates will provide the credibility that matters in our industry.

## What Makes This Different

As a trader who's been through the frustration of inadequate tools, I'm building Deltalytix with a clear understanding of what traders actually need. This isn't about creating the most complex platform or the one with the most features – it's about creating the most useful one.

Every decision we make is guided by real trading experience and actual user feedback. The result is a platform that feels intuitive because it's built by someone who uses it every day.

## Looking Forward

The next few months will be transformative for Deltalytix. With the Databento partnership, enhanced AI capabilities, and our growing community of traders, we're positioned to take trading analytics to the next level.

What excites me most is that we're just getting started. The foundation is solid, the growth is sustainable, and the vision is clear. Together, we're building something that will genuinely help traders improve their performance and achieve their goals.

Thank you to everyone who has been part of this journey. Your feedback, your trust, and your trading success stories are what drive us forward every day.
