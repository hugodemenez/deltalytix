# AI-powered CSV field mapping for any broker format

Different brokers export trade data in different formats. Our AI solves this by automatically understanding your CSV structure.

## How it works

When you upload a CSV file, the AI analyzes the column headers and sample data to determine what each field represents. It identifies entry/exit times, prices, quantities, instruments, and P&L values without manual configuration.

## Key capabilities

- **Automatic column detection**: AI recognizes common field names and data patterns
- **Tradovate support**: Native parsing for Tradovate export format
- **Rithmic support**: Native parsing for Rithmic performance reports
- **Commission tracking**: Automatic calculation and tracking of trading fees
- **Custom mappings**: Override AI suggestions when needed for unusual formats

## Supported fields

The system automatically detects:
- Entry and exit timestamps
- Buy/sell side
- Instrument/symbol
- Quantity/contracts
- Entry and exit prices
- Profit and loss
- Commission and fees

## Getting started

1. Upload your broker's CSV export
2. Review the AI-suggested field mappings
3. Adjust any incorrect mappings if needed
4. Import your trades
