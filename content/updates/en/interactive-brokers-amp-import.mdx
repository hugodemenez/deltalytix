# Expanding our universal broker integration capabilities

At Deltalytix, we understand that traders operate across various platforms and account types. Whether you're trading through a proprietary trading firm or managing your retail trading account, our mission is to provide seamless data integration for all your trading activities.

## Our vision for universal data integration

We believe that your trading data should be easily accessible and analyzable, regardless of where you execute your trades. This is why we're continuously expanding our integration capabilities to support more brokers and platforms. Today, we're excited to announce our upcoming integration with Interactive Brokers and AMP's Rithmic platform, marking another significant step toward our goal of universal broker support.

## New integrations: Interactive Brokers and AMP

### Interactive Brokers integration
Interactive Brokers integration will provide comprehensive support for:
- Proprietary trading accounts through professional trading firms

### AMP integration
Our AMP integration initially focuses on Rithmic platform support, with plans to expand to additional platforms:
- Full Rithmic data integration
- Future support for CQG integration (pending platform access)

This multi-platform approach ensures that traders using AMP can benefit from Deltalytix's analytics capabilities regardless of their preferred execution platform.
