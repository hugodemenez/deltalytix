# Tradovate synchronization and drag-and-drop account grouping

Manage multiple Tradovate accounts with automatic synchronization and organize all your accounts visually.

## Tradovate sync

Connect your Tradovate accounts using OAuth or custom access tokens. Trades sync automatically with background token renewal so you never lose connection.

### Key capabilities

- **OAuth authentication**: Connect with one click using Tradovate login
- **Custom tokens**: Use access tokens for advanced setups
- **Multi-account support**: Connect and sync multiple accounts
- **Automatic renewal**: Tokens refresh automatically in the background
- **Per-account controls**: Sync individual accounts or all at once

## Account grouping

Organize your accounts by dragging them into groups. Useful when managing multiple prop firm accounts, different strategies, or separating live from demo accounts.

### How it works

- **Drag-and-drop**: Move account "coins" between groups
- **Create groups**: Press Enter to create a new group
- **Hidden accounts**: Archive accounts you don't want to see
- **Visual organization**: Clear placeholders show where accounts will drop

## FTMO import improvements

Better handling of FTMO CSV exports with automatic default values for swap and commission fields when not provided.
