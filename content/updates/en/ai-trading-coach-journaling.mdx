# AI trading coach for self-reflection and journaling

Trading psychology matters as much as strategy. The AI coach helps you understand your patterns and improve your decision-making.

## How it works

The AI has secure access to your trading data. Ask questions about your performance, discuss specific trades, or explore patterns in your behavior. The AI identifies trends you might miss, like trading poorly after losses or overtrading during certain market conditions.

## Key capabilities

- **Data-aware conversations**: AI sees your actual trades and statistics
- **Pattern recognition**: Identifies recurring behaviors in your trading
- **Mood tracking**: Log your emotional state and correlate it with performance
- **Behavioral insights**: Get feedback on trading triggers and habits
- **Private and encrypted**: All conversations are secure and confidential

## What you can ask

- "What are my most common mistakes?"
- "How do I perform after a losing streak?"
- "Which setups have the best win rate?"
- "What time of day should I avoid trading?"
- "Summarize my trading this week"

## Journaling features

- **Daily notes**: Write reflections for each trading day
- **Trade comments**: Add notes to individual trades
- **Tag system**: Categorize trades by setup or strategy
- **Mood selector**: Track your emotional state each day
