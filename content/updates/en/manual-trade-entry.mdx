# Manual trade entry with auto-commission calculation

For brokers without automatic sync or when you need to add trades that weren't captured, manual entry provides a complete solution.

## How it works

Select "Manual Entry" from the import options. Fill in the trade details using the interactive form. The system calculates commissions automatically based on your previous trades for the same instrument.

## Trade entry form

Enter all trade details:

- **Instrument**: Symbol or contract name
- **Side**: Long or short
- **Entry time**: When you opened the position
- **Exit time**: When you closed the position
- **Entry price**: Your entry price
- **Exit price**: Your exit price
- **Quantity**: Number of contracts or shares
- **Commission**: Auto-calculated or manually entered

## Auto-commission calculation

The system looks at your historical trades for the same instrument and calculates the average commission per contract. This value is suggested automatically but can be overridden.

## Key capabilities

- **Form validation**: Required fields are validated before saving
- **Real-time P&L**: See calculated profit/loss as you enter data
- **Edit and delete**: Modify or remove manually entered trades anytime
- **Statistics**: Manual trades are included in all analytics and charts
- **Account assignment**: Assign trades to specific accounts
