# Journal with image resizing, tables, and session-based tags

A more powerful journal for documenting your trading with images, tables, and organized tagging.

## Image resizing

Drag the corners or edges of images to resize them. The aspect ratio is maintained automatically. Create side-by-side layouts for before/after chart comparisons.

## Table support

Create tables directly in the journal editor.

- **One-click creation**: Insert a 3x3 table with header row
- **Row/column controls**: Add or delete rows and columns from the bubble menu
- **Grid layouts**: Arrange content in structured formats

## Session-based tags

Apply tags to all trades for a specific day with one click.

### How it works

- View existing tags with trade counts (e.g., "scalping 2/3")
- Click a tag to apply it to all remaining trades for the day
- Create new tags on-the-fly and apply them immediately
- Visual checkmarks show which tags are applied to all trades

## Calendar trade review

The calendar modal now shows the full interactive trade table instead of a static list.

- Sort, filter, and page through trades
- Group and ungroup trades
- Edit times and instruments
- View images, tags, and comments
- Delete trades directly

## Real-time sync

Changes to trades, tags, and journal entries sync immediately across all views. No stale data.
