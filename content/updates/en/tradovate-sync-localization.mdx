# Tradovate sync interface now in your language

The Tradovate credentials manager and sync settings are now fully translated. This includes all labels, buttons, preset options, and success or error messages when setting your daily sync time.

When you set up automatic daily syncs for your Tradovate accounts, you'll see time presets like "Morning", "Midday", "After Close", and "Midnight" in your preferred language. The time picker dialog and all related messages are also localized, making it easier to configure sync schedules in English or French.

The interface automatically detects your language preference and displays everything accordingly, so you can manage your Tradovate sync settings without switching languages.
