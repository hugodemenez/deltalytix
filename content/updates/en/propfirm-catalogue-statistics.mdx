# Prop firms catalogue with performance statistics

Compare prop trading firms using real performance data from Deltalytix users.

## How it works

The catalogue aggregates anonymized data from traders using each prop firm. View statistics like total accounts, payout frequency, and success rates to make informed decisions about which firms to trade with.

## Available statistics

- **Account counts**: How many traders use each firm
- **Payout data**: Aggregated payout statistics
- **Success rates**: Percentage of accounts passing evaluations
- **Timeframe selection**: View data for current month or custom date ranges

## Timeframe controls

Filter statistics by time period:

- Current month
- Last 30/60/90 days
- Custom date range

See how prop firm performance varies over different periods.

## Multi-day filtering

New weekday filter allows selecting multiple days at once. Filter your charts to show only Monday and Tuesday performance, or any combination of days.

## Footer integration

Quick access to the prop firms catalogue from the main navigation footer.
