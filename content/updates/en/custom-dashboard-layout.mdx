# Custom Dashboard Layout: Your Trading Workspace, Your Rules

We're excited to announce a major upgrade to our trading platform: a fully customizable dashboard system that puts you in control of your trading environment. As traders ourselves, we understand that every trader has unique needs and preferences when it comes to analyzing market data and managing trades.

## Why Customization Matters

Trading can be overwhelming, especially when you're bombarded with too much information at once. That's why we've built our new dashboard system with a clear philosophy: show traders exactly what they need, when they need it. No more, no less.

Our approach allows you to start with a clean slate and build your perfect workspace by selecting only the tools and metrics that matter to your trading style. Whether you're a day trader focused on quick market movements or a swing trader analyzing longer-term patterns, you can now tailor your dashboard to support your strategy.

## A Suite of Powerful Widgets

We've developed a comprehensive collection of widgets that cover every aspect of trading analysis. From detailed chart analysis to quick statistical insights, each widget is designed to serve a specific purpose:

### Market Analysis & Trading Charts
At the heart of our system are powerful charting tools. You can track your equity progression, analyze profit and loss patterns, and understand your trading behavior through time-of-day analysis. Our tick distribution and market price charts provide deep insights into market movements, while commission impact analysis helps you optimize your trading costs.

### Performance Metrics That Matter
We've broken down complex trading statistics into digestible widgets. Track your average position time, monitor your winning streaks, and compare your performance across different trading sides (long vs. short). These metrics are available in various sizes - from tiny quick-view cards to detailed full-width analyses - allowing you to prioritize the information that matters most to your strategy.

### Journal Integration
Understanding the psychological aspects of trading is crucial. Our integrated journal features include a calendar-based PnL visualization, mood tracking, and a tagging system for categorizing trades. This helps you identify patterns in your trading behavior and maintain a structured approach to self-improvement.

### Market Intelligence
Stay informed with our real-time news feed and market analysis tools. For prop traders, we've included specialized widgets for tracking firm performance and requirements.

## Flexible Layout System

The true power of our new dashboard lies in its flexibility. Every widget can be:
- Dragged and dropped anywhere on your workspace
- Resized to show just the right amount of detail
- Configured to display on both desktop and mobile devices

Our intelligent layout system automatically optimizes the arrangement based on your screen size while maintaining your preferred organization. For data-intensive widgets like trade tables, we've implemented full-width options to ensure readability and usability.

## Looking Forward

This release is just the beginning. We're already working on expanding the customization options to include:
- Personalized color schemes and styling preferences
- Additional widget templates for specialized analysis
- The ability to create custom widgets
- Layout sharing capabilities for team collaboration
- Enhanced filtering options for deeper data analysis

Our goal is to provide you with a trading environment that adapts to your needs, not the other way around. We believe that by giving you the tools to create your ideal workspace, we're helping you focus on what really matters: making better trading decisions.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to enhance the platform with even more customization options and features. Your feedback will be crucial in shaping the future development of our dashboard system.
