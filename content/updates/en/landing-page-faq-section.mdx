# FAQ section on landing page

We added a new FAQ section to the landing page to answer common questions about Deltalytix. The section covers topics like how syncing works with different brokers, security, updates, and pricing.

The FAQ uses an expandable details format, so you can quickly scan questions and expand only the ones you're interested in. All questions and answers are available in both English and French.

You'll find the FAQ section at the bottom of the landing page, right after the pricing section. It's designed to help new visitors understand what Deltalytix does and how it works before they sign up.
