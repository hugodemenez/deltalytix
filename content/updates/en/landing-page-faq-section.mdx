# FAQ section on landing page

We added a FAQ section to the landing page to answer common questions visitors have about Deltalytix. You'll find answers about how syncing works, security, updates, and pricing.

The section uses an expandable format so you can quickly scan questions and open the ones you're curious about. It covers everything from how we sync your trading data to why the Plus plan doesn't have a trial period.

You can find the FAQ section at the bottom of the landing page, right before the open source section. All questions and answers are available in both English and French.
