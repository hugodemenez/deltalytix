# Tradovate sync time presets and localization

Setting up daily sync times for Tradovate accounts is now simpler. We added quick preset buttons for common times like morning, midday, after market close, and midnight. Instead of typing the time manually, you can click a preset and adjust if needed.

The sync time dialog is now fully translated to French, including all labels, descriptions, and preset names. The timezone note also shows your local timezone automatically, so you know exactly when syncs will run in your time.

These changes make it faster to configure multiple Tradovate accounts and ensure everything displays correctly whether you're using English or French.
