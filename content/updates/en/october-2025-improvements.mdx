# October 2025 Platform Improvements

We're excited to share a comprehensive set of improvements that enhance your trading analytics experience. This update focuses on making your workflow smoother, faster, and more intuitive.

## Immediate Updates & Import Enhancements

### Real-Time Data Synchronization
Trade edits, chat messages, mood updates, and user data changes now trigger immediate server refreshes. No more stale data - your changes appear instantly across all views.

### ATAS Excel Import Improvements
- Support for both `.xlsx` and `.xls` formats
- Automatic "Journal" sheet detection
- Comprehensive validation for required columns (Account, Instrument, Open/Close times/prices/volumes, PnL)
- Clear, actionable error messages when file format is incorrect
- Significantly fewer failed imports

### Enhanced Trade Upload Feedback
- Clear reporting of how many rows were successfully added
- Duplicate trade detection with visible results instead of silent skipping
- Better visibility into import operations

### Dashboard Layout Persistence
Widget changes (add/remove/restore) now save reliably, ensuring your customized layouts persist correctly across desktop and mobile devices.

## Dependency Management & Code Quality

### Cleaner Codebase
We've removed 16 unused dependencies while adding 5 that were actually being used but missing. This results in a net reduction of 11 dependencies (5.8% smaller footprint).

**Removed unused packages:**
- TipTap extensions not in use
- React Email components
- Legacy theme management
- Unused PDF generation libraries
- Commented-out code dependencies

**Added missing packages:**
- TipTap core and collaboration (Yjs)
- PapaParse for CSV parsing
- MDX type definitions

### Improved TypeScript Types
- Refactored widget-canvas to use proper `Widget[]` types instead of `Prisma.JsonValue`
- Created `DashboardLayoutWithWidgets` type for better internal type safety
- Added `toPrismaLayout()` helper function for clean type conversions
- Eliminated excessive type casting throughout the codebase

## Journal & Tagging Improvements

### Session-Based Tag Management
Apply tags to all trades for a specific day with a single action:
- View existing tags with trade counts (e.g., "scalping (2/3)")
- One-click to apply incomplete tags to remaining trades
- Create new tags on-the-fly and apply them to all trades
- Works even when no trades exist yet (for planning ahead)
- Instant UI feedback with optimistic updates
- Visual checkmarks for tags applied to all trades

### Journal Image Capabilities
Enhanced TipTap editor with professional layout features:

**Image Resizing:**
- Interactive resize handles on images
- Drag corners/edges while maintaining aspect ratio
- Visual feedback with hover effects

**Grid Layouts & Tables:**
- One-click table creation (3×3 with header row)
- Contextual bubble menu when cursor is inside tables
- Add/delete rows and columns before/after current position
- Create side-by-side layouts for before/after comparisons

**Content Alignment:**
- Left, center, and right alignment controls
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick adjustments
- Works seamlessly with resizable images

This enables professional layouts like:
- Before/after trading screenshots placed side-by-side
- Trade setup images with accompanying analysis text
- Multi-image comparisons in grid format
- Structured notes with aligned content

## Chat & Calendar Enhancements

### Chat History Improvements
- More robust loading and saving of chat messages
- Better handling of older and newer message formats
- Consistent conversation rehydration across sessions

### Interactive Calendar Trade Review
The calendar modal now shows the full interactive trade review table instead of a static list:
- Page, sort, and select trades
- Group/ungroup trades
- Delete and edit times/instruments
- View images, tags, comments, and video links
- Full table controls preserved for the selected day

## Technical Improvements

### Code Organization
- Standardized trade creation using `createTradeWithDefaults` factory function across FTMO, IBKR PDF, and Tradovate imports
- Improved error logging in Tradovate synchronization
- Enhanced Rithmic import with extended 400-day lookback window
- Removed unused debugging tools and dead code

### Performance Optimizations
- Better date handling for daily comments (no more load/save errors)
- Improved journal editor keys preventing stale content display
- Horizontal scrolling for tables preventing clipped columns
- More stable editor content updates

## User Experience

### Proxy Updates
Now allows requests from wildcard deltalytix.app subdomains, enabling seamless integrations across different environments.

### UI Polish
- Loading skeleton displays during data fetch operations
- Success notifications for save operations
- Improved tag-filter search and messaging
- Better error handling with user-friendly feedback
