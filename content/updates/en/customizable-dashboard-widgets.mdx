# Customizable dashboard with drag-and-drop widgets

Every trader analyzes differently. The widget system lets you create a dashboard tailored to your workflow.

## How it works

Choose from 20+ available widgets and arrange them on your dashboard. Drag widgets to reposition them, resize them to show more or less detail, and remove anything you don't need. Your layout is saved and syncs across devices.

## Available widgets

- **Calendar**: Daily P&L visualization
- **Trade table**: Full list of trades with sorting and filtering
- **PnL by side**: Compare long vs short performance
- **Time of day**: Hourly performance breakdown
- **Weekday PnL**: Performance by day of week
- **Tick distribution**: Per-instrument tick analysis
- **Commissions**: Fee impact on your P&L
- **Trade distribution**: Win/loss/breakeven breakdown
- **Prop firm tracker**: Monitor prop firm account status
- **Journal**: Daily notes and reflections
- **News feed**: Market news and events

## Key capabilities

- **Drag-and-drop**: Move widgets anywhere on the canvas
- **Resizable**: Make widgets larger or smaller
- **Mobile-responsive**: Layouts adapt to phone and tablet screens
- **Persistent**: Your layout saves automatically
- **Restore defaults**: Reset to the default layout anytime
