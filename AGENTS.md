# AI Agent Guide for Next.js 15 Project

## Project Structure Overview

- **Components:**
  - UI components are located in `@/components/ui` (shadcn).
  - Main components are located in `@/components`.

- **Pages:**
  - Landing page is located in `app/(landing)`.
  - Dashboard is located in `app/dashboard`.
  - Each route in `app/` has a corresponding component folder for specific components.

- **API:**
  - API endpoints are located in `app/api`.

## Guidelines for AI Agents

1. **Component Usage:**
   - Use shadcn components from `@/components/ui` for consistent UI elements.
   - Main components in `@/components` should be used for specific functionality.
   - Each route in `app/` has a dedicated component folder for its specific components.

2. **Page Navigation:**
   - Ensure proper routing between the landing page and dashboard.
   - Use Next.js routing conventions for navigation.

3. **API Integration:**
   - Interact with the API endpoints in `app/api` for data fetching and manipulation.
   - Ensure proper error handling and data validation.

4. **Best Practices:**
   - Follow Next.js 15 best practices for performance and SEO.
   - Maintain a clean and modular code structure.

5. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for components and API endpoints.
   - Ensure all tests pass before deploying changes.

6. **Documentation:**
   - Keep documentation up-to-date with any changes made to the codebase.
   - Use comments to explain complex logic or decisions.

## Conclusion

This guide is intended to help AI agents navigate and contribute to the Next.js 15 project effectively. Follow the guidelines to ensure consistency and quality in the codebase.
