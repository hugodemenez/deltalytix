# Recipe: Typography Animation

Use for titles, title cards, quotes, kinetic typography, text reveals, captions,
handwritten/path reveals, text morphs, counters, and short message-led scenes.

## User-Language Aliases

- "animate this headline", "make a title card", "kinetic type", "quote reveal"
- "handwritten text", "draw this word on", "typewriter", "morph this text"
- "add text for X", "caption this", "animated number/stat"

## Defaults

- Ask for exact copy only if missing.
- Default to transparent background for overlay/title elements; use a slotted
  background for full-frame title cards.
- Prefer readable hierarchy over novelty.
- Establish type hierarchy, line composition, and final-frame balance before
  adding accents or effects.
- Choose the type voice deliberately: serif for human/editorial authority,
  grotesque for product/function, monospace for technical labels, expressive
  display type when the word itself is the subject.
- Convert fixed prompt text to vector/shape artwork immediately. In the current
  player, native Lottie text and text slots render reliably only when matching
  font blobs are supplied to Skottie, and the scene loader does not pass font
  files by default.

## Category Distinctions

- Title card: strong final still, clear hierarchy, restrained reveal.
- Quote reveal: reading pace, line rhythm, attribution after the main idea.
- Editorial text reveal: polished line breaks, masks, layout, and negative
  space.
- Handwritten/path reveal: natural stroke order, trim timing, and ink hold.
- Kinetic typography: type-driven choreography tied to meaning, not only a text
  entrance.
- Text morph: compatible paths only; otherwise use mask, crossfade, replacement,
  or layout change.
- Text-on-path or camera-follow text: typography remains primary; use camera
  scene motion as secondary only when framing movement is requested.

## Typography Roles

- Anchor text stabilizes the composition and may stay still or move subtly.
- Support text provides context and should usually be calmer than the main
  phrase.
- Active text carries the main motion idea. For kinetic typography, choose at
  least one active word or phrase before authoring.

## Kinetic Quality Bar

- For "kinetic typography", animate at least one major word or phrase with
  meaning-driven position, scale, masking, layout change, framing/camera
  movement, rhythmic timing, or emphasis.
- Slide, fade, scale, and stagger are valid tools, but uniform entrance motion
  applied to every word is not enough for kinetic typography.
- Preserve readability. Kinetic type needs contrast between active motion and
  stillness; not every word should compete for attention.
- Let semantic words influence motion: `fall` drops, `rise` lifts, `snap` hits
  sharply, `break` separates, `flow` travels smoothly, `soft` eases gently,
  `heavy` lands with weight, `loud` expands or hits harder, `quiet` recedes,
  `fast` compresses timing, and `slow` holds longer.

## Presets

- `title-clean`: restrained title reveal with strong final still.
- `editorial-reveal`: calm mask reveal, line rhythm, slight position settle.
- `quote-lift`: quote enters by line, attribution follows after a readable beat.
- `kinetic-word-choreography`: one active word drives layout, scale, or rhythm.
- `kinetic-snap`: semantic active word hits sharply, support text stays calmer.
- `statement-mask`: line-by-line mask reveal with strong still-frame hierarchy.
- `word-per-beat`: one word or phrase owns each beat, then resolves to a held
  lockup.
- `typewriter-clean`: stepped character/word reveal with a soft cursor/accent.
- `handwritten-trace`: path reveal following writing direction, subtle ink hold.
- `text-morph-lite`: crossfade/mask/position replacement unless paths are safe.
- `text-path-follow`: text follows a curve or camera-framed path while readable.
- `numeric-pop`: numbers scale or count in, supporting labels settle softly.

## Timing And Easing

- Short title/card: 60-120 frames.
- Longer quote: 90-180 frames.
- Typewriter/handwritten: pace by readability, not constant path length alone.
- Use ease-out for entrances, stepped timing for typewriter, and low overshoot
  only for kinetic/playful styles.
- Kinetic typography: build around phrase-level beats; active words can move
  more strongly while anchor/support text holds the composition.

## Ask Only When Needed

- Ask for exact text if absent.
- Ask for brand/font constraints when source context is missing and typography is
  central.
- Ask whether output should be full-frame or transparent if ambiguous.

## Construction Notes

- Break text into semantic lines, words, or glyph groups based on the preset.
- Keep line lengths short enough for the canvas and target use.
- Keep one focal line or phrase dominant; support text should clarify rather
  than compete.
- Use masks or shape reveals for premium title work; use opacity/position
  stagger for simpler captions.
- Use per-line mask reveals and meaning-based line breaks for statement/title
  work. Avoid random per-letter motion unless the prompt asks for it.
- For kinetic typography, define anchor, support, and active text roles before
  keyframing.
- Avoid applying the same opacity/position/scale entrance to every word. Offset
  properties and timing according to meaning, reading order, and emphasis.
- Use lines, dots, dividers, glows, and ornaments only when they guide reading
  order, reveal text, emphasize a word, support rhythm, or reinforce semantic
  motion.
- Use path morphing only with compatible path structures; otherwise use
  replacement, reveal, or crossfade.
- Expose useful slots: text content when supported, accent color, background
  color for full-frame cards, and timing/scale only when user editing matters.
- Use native text slots only when editable text is explicitly required and font
  asset loading has been implemented and verified in the official player.

## Common Failure Modes

- Text becomes unreadable mid-animation.
- Line breaks feel accidental.
- The final frame is visually weaker than the motion.
- Handwritten reveals move against the natural stroke direction.
- Text morphs warp because path structures are incompatible.
- Kinetic typography is only a uniform word-by-word entrance.
- Every word moves equally, so no active phrase leads the viewer.
- Decorative accents fill space but do not guide reading or meaning.
- Type accents or effects arrive before the hierarchy and line breaks are
  resolved.
- Typeface choice does not match the message tone.

## Acceptance Checks

- First and final frames are clean still compositions.
- Text is readable at all inspected frames.
- Staggering supports meaning instead of making words hard to follow.
- Kinetic prompts have an active word or phrase with semantic, type-driven
  motion.
- Anchor/support text stabilizes the composition and does not compete with the
  active phrase.
- Accents support reading rhythm, reveal, emphasis, or semantic motion.
- Type hierarchy, line breaks, and optical placement pass before effects are
  considered polish.
- If type is the subject, each major beat is readable as a strong still frame.
- No text touches unsafe edges or clips during motion.
